# DBoxAudioStreamer

DBoxAudioStreamer allows audio streaming from the DropBox public folder. I made this before we had cloud based music storage so I could listen to my favorite songs on any device with an internet connection and a browser. 

## Installation
1. Copy entire content of DBoxAudioStreamer to your DropBox public folder containing audio files.
2. Run 'lmake.py'.

## Usage

1. Get public link to 'player.htm'
2. Visit link to launch audio player
