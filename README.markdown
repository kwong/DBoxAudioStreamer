# DBoxAudioStreamer

DBoxAudioStreamer allows audio streaming from the DropBox public folder. I made this before we had cloud based music storage so I could listen to my favorite songs on any device with an internet connection and a browser. JPlayer is used as the music player due to its simplicity (and easy to customize for when I made this as I'm not a javascript guru ^^;)

## Installation
1. Copy entire content of DBoxAudioStreamer to your DropBox public folder containing audio files.
2. Run 'lmake.py', which generates a playlist in xml for the player

## Usage

1. Get public link to 'player.htm'
2. Visit link to launch audio player
